# Version 1.x

## Introduction

Version 1 was written to replace the older `ganbarodigital/php-unit-test-helpers` library. That's one of the first libraries that we developed in this style. The API is largely the same.

## Components

Version 1 ships with the following components:

Namespace | Purpose
----------|--------
[`GanbaroDigital\UnitTestHelpers\V1\ClassesAndObjects`](ClassesAndObjects/index.html) | help with testing your classes and objects
[`GanbaroDigital\UnitTestHelpers\V1\Exceptions`](Exceptions/index.html) | exceptions that can be thrown by the V1 API

Click on the namespace to learn more about the classes in that component.
